Dear Karen
Getting a look at the initial mockups for Imela Ventures, youâ€™ve established a very clean
and professional visual direction.
Following up on our conversation, I've consolidated my analysis into a technical and
strategic blueprint. The goal here is to bridge the gap between the strong visual design
and a high-performance digital marketing platform. The following recommendations are
focused on optimizing the architecture, user experience, and conversion pathways to
ensure the new site doesn't just look good, but actively drives user engagement and
delivers on key performance indicators.
Technical Recommendations for Imela Ventures Website Build
Here is a summary of the UI/UX and IA recommendations for the Imela Ventures project.
The current mockups provide a strong visual foundation, but the following adjustments
are critical for performance, usability, and conversion rate optimization.
1. Critical: Rearchitect the Information Architecture (IA) for Audience Segmentation
Issue: The current IA merges B2C and B2B user flows, creating a disjointed user journey
and diluting content relevance.
Action Plan:
- Implement a user-selection module in the homepage hero section. This should
direct users to one of two distinct site sections: /personal-services or
/corporate-services.
- Restructure the primary navigation to reflect this split. The nav element should
contain links like: "Personal Therapy," "Corporate Services," "Workshops," "About Us,"
etc., instead of a generic "Services" link.
- Ensure each section (/personal and /corporate) has its own sub-navigation and
tailored landing pages for its specific services.
2. UI/UX & Component Optimization
CTA Hierarchy & Consistency:
- Issue: Multiple, competing CTA styles and copy (Book Session, Schedule Workshop,
Book Free Consultation) create user friction.
- Action Plan: Standardize the CTA components. Establish a cta-primary class for the
main conversion goal (e.g., "Schedule a Consultation") and a cta-secondary class
for informational links (e.g., "Learn More"). Ensure CTA copy is consistent across the
site for the same action.
Hero Carousel/Slider:
- Issue: The auto-scrolling card component is a known UI anti-pattern that harms
usability and information retention.
- Action Plan: Deprecate the auto-scrolling functionality. Replace it with either a
static grid displaying the top 3 services or a user-controlled slider with clear
prev/next controls and pagination dots.
Accessibility:
- Issue: The white text on the gradient CTA block may not meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast
ratio requirements.
- Action Plan: Use a contrast checker tool to validate the text against the lightest
parts of the gradient. If it fails, apply a subtle text-shadow or adjust the gradient to
ensure compliance.
Build Out New Modules:
- Team Showcase: Create a reusable content module for team member profiles
(image, name, title, short bio). This will be deployed on a new "Meet the Team" page.
- Testimonial/Social Proof Block: Develop a flexible module for displaying
testimonials (quote, attribution) and another for case studies/client logos (for the
/corporate section). These need to be easily deployable across various pages.
- Content Hub (Blog/Resources): Structure the CMS to support a "Resources" section
with standard article templates, category taxonomy, and tagging functionality to
support future content marketing eorts.
-
Footer Enhancement:
- Action Plan: Add social media profile links and embed the cta-primary component
in the footer to provide a persistent conversion point.
By implementing these structural and component-level changes, we will create a more
intuitive, performant, and accessible website that is properly optimized for its target
users.
Conclusion
To summarize, these recommendations are designed to evolve the platform from a static
digital brochure into a dynamic, conversion-optimized, and user-centric asset. By
re-architecting the user flow and refining the UI components, we will create a technically
sound and strategically eective website that serves both the users' needs and Imela
Ventures' business objectives.
