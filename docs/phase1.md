Phase 1: Your Professional Website
This is the foundation. The goal is to create a trustworthy and professional online presence where
potential clients can learn about your services and easily book an appointment.
What we will build:
- A clean, professional website showcasing your therapy services, group classes, and workshops.
- Clear sections for different client groups (e.g., Adults, Teens, Couples).
- A simple booking page connected to a scheduling tool.
- A secure area to host premium video content for your members
